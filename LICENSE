Oxygen Low License Open Source (OLLOS-1.0)
=================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Oxygen-Low

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to
use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies
of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to
do so, subject to the following terms and conditions:

1. Definitions
--------------
a. "Software" means the copyrighted work identified above, including source
   code, object code, binaries, libraries, modules, and associated
   documentation provided by the copyright owner.

b. "Component" means the Software when distributed as a distinct library,
   module, package, or other discrete software component that can be
   incorporated into a larger work.

c. "Distribute" or "Distribution" means any transfer, publication, sale,
   lease, sublicense, rental, transmission, or making available to third
   parties.

2. Grant of rights
------------------
Subject to the terms of this License, the copyright owner grants to any
recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to:
   a. Use, reproduce, publicly display, perform, and execute the Software;
   b. Prepare derivative works of, and modify, the Software;
   c. Distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software in source
      or object (binary) form; and
   d. Permit third parties to exercise the foregoing rights on the same
      terms.

3. License placement and scope of obligations
--------------------------------------------
a. The full text of this License and the copyright notice above must be
   included with the copy of the Software that is distributed (for example,
   in the same repository, package, or distribution bundle that contains the
   Software's files). This requirement applies to the Software as a discrete
   Component.

b. If the Software is included (bundled or linked) into a larger work, the
   larger work **is not required** to adopt this License for the larger
   work, provided that the copy of the Software Component included with, or
   distributed alongside, the larger work continues to carry this License
   and the License text remains accessible where the Component is located
   (for example, in the library's directory, package metadata, or
   accompanying files). In short: **only the Component itself needs to
   carry this License**; the containing project does not need to rewrite
   its own license to match this one.

4. Attribution and authorship
-----------------------------
a. You must not misrepresent the origin of the Software. You may not claim
   authorship of the original Software unless you are the original author(s)
   or have been explicitly credited as such.

b. You must not remove, alter, or obscure existing copyright notices,
   author credits, or license notices contained in the Software.

c. If you distribute a modified version of the Software as a distinct
   Component, you are encouraged (but not strictly required) to include a
   prominent notice stating that you changed the Software and describing
   the nature of the changes. Any false claim of original authorship is a
   material breach of this License.

5. No copyleft; redistribution of derivative and larger works
-----------------------------------------------------------
This License is permissive and non-copyleft. Recipients may distribute
derivative works or larger works that include the Software under any
license of their choosing, provided that any distributed copy of the
original Software Component continues to include this License and the
copyright notice as required in Section 3.

6. Patent grant
---------------
To the extent you hold patent rights that would necessarily be infringed by
the practice of the Software as provided, you hereby grant recipients a
license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer
the Software under those patent claims, on the same terms as this License.
This paragraph does not grant patent rights beyond those necessarily
implicated by using the Software as distributed.

7. Disclaimer of warranty
-------------------------
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT THAT A WARRANTY IS PROVIDED IN WRITING BY THE COPYRIGHT OWNER.
Unless an express, written warranty is provided by the copyright owner, no
warranty is granted.

8. Limitation of liability and termination
-----------------------------------------
a. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
   CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
   TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
   SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE, EXCEPT WHERE A
   WRITTEN WARRANTY IS PROVIDED AS STATED IN SECTION 7.

b. Any attempt to remove or alter this License text or the copyright
   notice from a distributed copy of the Software (including removal of
   attribution or falsely claiming original authorship) will automatically
   terminate the rights granted to the violating party under this License.
   Terminated parties must cease distribution and use of the Software under
   the terminated rights; however, such termination does not affect
   downstream recipients who lawfully received the Software prior to
   termination.

9. Export controls and compliance
---------------------------------
Recipients shall comply with all applicable export, import, and sanctions
laws and regulations. This License does not authorize any activity prohibited
by such laws.

10. Miscellaneous
-----------------
a. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, the
   remainder of the License shall remain in full force and effect.

b. This License is intended to be technology- and jurisdiction-neutral and
   should be interpreted with that objective in mind.
