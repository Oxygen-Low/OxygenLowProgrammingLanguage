# OxyCode
Free to use, simple to install programming language for all uses.

## About

This is probably going to become a much more bigger project than what i've been doing.
The primary goal is to create a simple-to-use programming language that anyone can use easily.

## Help/Tutorials

If you want to use/learn the programming language, read the wiki.
If you need help with a feature, use discussions.
If you encounter a bug, report it in issues (check if a report for the same issue already exists).

## Licensing

The IDE and programming language are both licensed under the [Oxygen Low License Open Source](https://github.com/Oxygen-Low/OxygenLowLicense)
